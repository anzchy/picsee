# Audit dimensions: what both pre-landing auditors check

This is the single list of audit dimensions for picsee. Both auditors load it:
- `gpt-auditor` (Codex);
- `fable-auditor` (Claude).

Change it here, never in a brief or an agent wrapper. The two verdicts can only challenge each other
if they cover the same ground, so a dimension one auditor checks and the other doesn't is a defect
in the process, not a style choice.

**Where the list comes from.**
- The base was the nine "full" dimensions of `/cc-suite:audit`, a plugin prompt. No published source
  for that list was found.
- It was reordered and extended against the published guidance:
  - Google Engineering Practices, *What to look for in a code review*: design first, then functionality
    including concurrency, complexity, tests, naming, comments, documentation;
  - ISO/IEC 25010: reliability and recoverability, performance efficiency, security, interaction
    capability including inclusivity;
  - Bacchelli & Bird 2013: review also transfers knowledge.
- Two dimensions were added because picsee's P0 risk sits there:
  - design and architecture fit;
  - concurrency and cancellation.
- "Redundant code" and "maintainability" were merged into one dimension.

## The dimensions

| ID | Dimension | What it asks in picsee |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Design & architecture fit | Does the change belong, in this target, now? Does it respect the target split and dependency direction in [architecture §2.1](../PICSEE_ARCHITECTURE.md), and the ADRs in `docs/adr/` (for example ADR-001: AppKit owns windows)? Is it the simplest design that meets the brief, with no speculative generality? |
| D2 | Correctness & reliability | Does it do what the brief's ACs say on ordinary and edge paths? Covers error handling, failure and recovery paths (a missing file, a revoked grant, a corrupt image), and state left behind after a failure. |
| D3 | Concurrency & cancellation | Swift 6 isolation (`@MainActor`, `Sendable`, actors), data races, ordering, re-entrancy. A cancelled or superseded request must never deliver a stale result. No blocking I/O or decoding on the main thread. |
| D4 | Security, privacy & sandbox | The sandbox stays on and entitlements stay minimal. Covers security-scoped bookmark lifetime and whether access is released, secrets, and personal paths or e-mail in logs. Log fields are `.public` only when they are non-personal. No research material (`evidence/`, `design/`, npm, HTML/CSS) in any target. |
| D5 | Testing & validation | Do the tests prove each AC? Is the RED real, recorded before the code it tests? Are there missing cases: an edge, a failure, a concurrent case? Does each claim marked as proven on a real device have device evidence, as the [verification guide](../guide/feature-verification-guide.md) requires? |
| D6 | User-visible behaviour & accessibility | Does the UI behave as the brief and the [design spec](../../design/DESIGN.md) say? Check keyboard paths, VoiceOver labels, light and dark appearance, and Retina versus @1x rendering. Shortcuts that are shown must actually work, and no unimplemented feature may be hinted at. |
| D7 | Performance & resources | Main-thread work, memory peaks, cache growth, work repeated per frame, CI and build time. Numbers must be measured; an untested number is a finding. |
| D8 | Observability | Is there enough logging and `os_signpost` to diagnose this change in the field, at the right privacy level? Is there any noisy logging on hot paths? |
| D9 | Maintainability & readability | Duplication, dead code, unclear names, long functions, deep nesting, leftover TODOs and workarounds. Comments should explain why, not what. |
| D10 | Compliance with rules | The brief's scope and out-of-scope list, AGENTS.md rules, commit format and the `Implemented-by:`/`Validated-by:` trailers, and the ledger rules in [`feature-ledger.md`](../feature-ledger.md). |
| D11 | Dependencies & environment | The toolchain lock (Xcode 26.6 / 17F113), CI runner and tool pins (versions, checksums, action SHAs). Every new dependency needs a reason. |
| D12 | Documentation & knowledge transfer | Validation records state only what was run. ADRs, the glossary and AGENTS.md stay true after the change. Would the next agent understand why the change was made? |

**Every dimension is checked on every audit.** When a change cannot touch a dimension, the auditor says
`n/a` and gives a reason in a few words (for example, `D6 n/a: no UI change`). An auditor does not drop
dimensions to save time. The risk tier changes how deep each check goes, not which dimensions are
checked:
- **Low** tier (docs, config): D1, D4, D10, D11 and D12 at full depth; the rest only for whatever the
  change actually touches.
- **Medium** tier: all dimensions at full depth.
- **High** tier (sandbox, file grants, deletion and other writes, concurrency core): all dimensions,
  plus a reproduction or a counter-proof for every D3 and D4 finding.

## Severity

| Severity | Meaning | Blocks landing |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Data loss, a security or sandbox hole, or silent corruption on an ordinary path | Yes |
| High | One of: a defect a user or CI reaches on an ordinary path; an AC claimed but not met; a broken rule (dependency direction, research material shipped, sandbox weakened, a stale result delivered, an invented number) | Yes |
| Medium | A real defect or risk off the ordinary path, or debt with a concrete cost | No; counted, listed briefly |
| Low | A nit: style, naming, a small clean-up | No; counted only |

- Every Critical or High needs three things: the file and line, an ordered trace of how an ordinary path
  reaches it, and the reason existing tests or checks miss it. A suspicion without a trace is at most
  Medium.
- An auditor never downgrades its own High without a reproduction or a counter-proof.
- A defect in code the change did not touch counts only when the change makes it reachable.
- The goal is better code health overall, not perfection: Lows never block.
- A range over about 400 changed lines of production code gets a Medium recommending a split.

## Independence

Round one is blind:
- neither auditor reads the other's report folder, the delegator's notes, or PR comments;
- both get the same range, tier and AC list at the same time;
- the delegator merges the two verdicts.

A Low item from `gpt-imple-3` has one blind auditor, `picsee-fable-auditor`, with no merge or
challenge step; if that auditor raises the tier above Low, the item returns to two auditors.

When the auditors disagree on a finding, the delegator sends it as a `challenge` to the auditor that
did not raise it. That auditor confirms the finding with its own trace or refutes it with a
reproduction or a counter-proof. "Unlikely" is not a refutation.

## Report shape

```
VERDICT   <audit|confirm|challenge> · <item> @ <sha7>   (range <base7>..<sha7>)   tier <Low|Medium|High>
COVERAGE  D1 ok|n/a — <few words> · D2 … · … · D12 …
AC        AC-1 PROVED|NOT PROVED|WRONG — <own evidence>   (one line per AC)
FINDINGS
  F1. [Critical|High] D<n> <dimension> · <file:line> · <issue>
      trace: <ordered steps>
      fix: <one line>
  M1. [Medium] D<n> · <file:line> · <issue>
CONFIRM   (confirm mode) <finding id>: CLOSED|PARTIAL|OPEN — <evidence>
COUNT     C<n> H<n> M<n> L<n>   BLOCKING C<n> H<n>
```

The delegator rejects a report that has no `COVERAGE` line, or that skips a dimension without a reason.
