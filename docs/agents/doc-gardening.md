# Doc gardening: keeping the feature ledger true

This is the single procedure for the picsee doc gardener. Two thin wrappers load it:
- `.claude/agents/picsee-doc-gardener.md` for Claude Code;
- `.codex/agents/picsee-doc-gardener.toml` for Codex.

Change the procedure here, never in a wrapper.

**Why it exists.** `docs/feature-ledger.md` is the system of record for what picsee can do. The rule is that
the commit that changes a behaviour also rewrites its row. The ledger's own gate can't tell whether a
sentence is still true, and authors forget. The gardener runs on every PR that can affect the ledger and
catches the rows the change made stale. This follows two published practices:
- OpenAI's harness-engineering team runs a recurring doc-gardening agent that scans for stale docs and
  opens fix-up PRs, because repository knowledge is the system of record;
- Anthropic's long-running-agent harness lets an agent change a feature's status only after it has
  verified that feature end to end, and forbids removing or editing tests.

## When it runs

The caller runs the gate script first and starts the gardener only when it prints `RUN`:

```sh
node scripts/ledger/garden-gate.mjs <base> HEAD                                         # PR opens
node scripts/ledger/garden-gate.mjs <base> HEAD --since <gardened-head> --verdict <V>   # re-push
```

`<base>` is `git merge-base main HEAD`; `<gardened-head>` is the head the last gardener verdict `<V>` was
for. The script prints one line and its reason on stderr. Any other line goes into the PR body verbatim.

| Situation | Rule | Gate prints |
|---|---|---|
| No changed path is mapped, and no commit names a ledger row ID or a plan WP ID | **Skip** the gardener | `Ledger-Gardener: SKIP <base7>..<head7> (no mapped paths)` |
| PR opens and the range is mapped | Run `pr` once | `RUN` |
| Re-push after a fix round or a rebase, last verdict CLEAN or UPDATED | Rerun only if the commits since the gardened head are mapped; otherwise reuse the verdict for the new head | `Ledger-Gardener: REUSE <V> <base7>..<head7> (no mapped change since <S7>)` or `RUN` |
| After NEEDS-OWNER | No rerun when every commit since the gardened head changes only the ledger md/html, no 状态, 验证 or 怎么确认 cell and no row is added or removed, and the HTML check passes | `Ledger-Gardener: RESOLVED <base7>..<head7> (owner fixed rows after NEEDS-OWNER at <S7>)` or `RUN` |
| Last verdict BLOCK | Always rerun | `RUN` |

**Mapped** means a changed path is under `App/`, `Packages/*/Sources/` or `docs/validation/`, is `project.yml`,
`docs/feature-ledger.md` or `docs/feature-ledger.html`, or is named (or under a directory named) in a 在哪 cell.
Commit messages are mapped when they name an existing row ID or a `P<n>-<nn>[a-z]?` work package. Other tooling,
`.github/` and design pages are not mapped unless a 在哪 cell names them.

The gate fails closed. A `--since` that is not an ancestor of head, as after a rebase, makes it judge the whole
merge-base..head range, so a mapped PR gives `RUN`. Any error (unknown ref, unreadable ledger, git failure) gives `RUN`.
The gate never writes the ledger: SKIP, REUSE and RESOLVED set no area review date.
The gate ignores branch names: it maps IDs only from commit messages, and paths only from the changed files.

| Mode | Trigger | Range |
|---|---|---|
| `pr` | The gate printed `RUN` before a PR opens or a PR head is re-pushed. Whoever opens the PR runs both: the delegator under rule 70, or any session or person running `gh pr create` | `git merge-base main HEAD`..`HEAD` |
| `full` | Once a week, scheduled by the delegator; when the user asks; or when an area in the ledger's Part 3 table is more than 30 days past its last review and code in it has changed | the whole ledger against the working tree |

A PR is not opened without a `Ledger-Gardener:` line for its head, from the gardener or the gate. The PR body
carries that line (see Output).

## What you may change, and what you may only propose

The asymmetry is the point. **You may make the ledger more cautious, never more optimistic.**
A wrong downgrade costs one re-check. A wrong upgrade is the false claim the ledger exists to prevent.

**Apply yourself.** These are edits to `docs/feature-ledger.md` (and, after them, its generated HTML) only:
1. **Moved paths.** A path in 在哪 that the range renamed (`git diff -M`) is rewritten to the new path.
2. **Deleted paths.** A path the range deleted is removed from 在哪. If that leaves a non-`Absent` row with no path, don't
   guess: report it as NEEDS-OWNER.
3. **Lost evidence.** A row whose linked `docs/validation/` record no longer exists, or no longer mentions
   the row's ID, is downgraded:
   - 验证 drops to the strongest evidence that remains;
   - `Shipped` becomes `Partial`;
   - one sentence is appended to 怎么确认: `限制：真机记录缺失（<file>），待复验。`

   Nothing else in that cell changes.
4. **Broken links.** A link to a renamed file is repointed. A link with no target is reported, not deleted.
5. **Area review.** For each ledger area the range touched, set its Part 3 row to today's date and reviewer
   `doc-gardener`, and replace its 备注 cell with the range `<base7>..<head7>`. Findings go in your report and
   the PR body, never in the ledger.

**Propose only.** Write these into the report for the owner. Never edit them yourself:
- any state or 验证 upgrade, whatever evidence you see;
- a new row, for a new capability or for a declared name with no row;
- any change to 能力, or to 怎么确认 beyond the sentence allowed in step 3;
- moving a row to 不做, or back.

## Procedure

1. **Inputs.** You need the mode; for `pr`, the branch's worktree path, the base and the head SHA; and the
   PR's ID or branch name. Anything missing returns BLOCKED.
2. **Read** `docs/feature-ledger.md` in full: its rules first, then its rows. Read the work package IDs in
   `docs/PICSEE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
3. **Collect the change.**
   - `git diff --name-status -M <base> <head>`
   - `git log --format='%H %s%n%b' <base>..<head>`
4. **Map the change to rows.** A row is *touched* when any of these holds:
   - **path**: a changed file is in its 在哪 cell, or under a directory named there;
   - **ID**: the row ID appears in a commit message, a changed test's name or path, a changed
     `docs/validation/` file, or the branch name;
   - **plan**: a work package ID in a commit message or the branch name is in its 计划 cell;
   - **surface**: a changed file adds or removes a declared name, meaning a CommandRouter command ID, a
     menu item identifier, a `DisplayPreferences` key, an entitlement, or an `Info.plist` UTType. Use the
     source tree layout in `docs/PICSEE_ARCHITECTURE.md` to find them.
5. **Judge each touched row.** Each row lands in exactly one of these:
   - **Updated.** The range already edits that row consistently.
   - **Stale.** Behaviour on the row's paths changed, but the row did not. Propose the edit: the new state,
     a 限制 if needed, and the evidence. Check the claim against the code at `<head>`, not the commit
     message.
   - **Unaffected.** The change provably has no user-visible effect, such as a pure rename, a test-only
     change, or a comment. Give the reason in one line.
6. **Integrity checks across the whole range:**
   - **Weakened acceptance.** In the same range, a row's state or 验证 went up **and** the acceptance
     itself in 怎么确认 was rewritten. This verdict is BLOCK. Appending or editing `限制：` text does
     not block; any acceptance rewrite goes in a separate commit that cites the user's words or an ADR.
     状态升级的那次提交，可以追加或修改「限制：」文本，但不得改写「怎么确认」中的验收本身。确需改验收时，单独提交并在提交说明里引用用户原话或 ADR。
   - **Upgrade without evidence.** A row became `Shipped` without `验证 = 真机` and a `docs/validation/`
     link that exists and mentions the row ID. This verdict is BLOCK.
   - **Entry points not all verified.** A row went up to `验证 = 真机` or `Shipped`, but its 怎么确认 lists
     several entry points or values (joined by 或, /, 、) and the linked `docs/validation/` record has no
     verdict line for one of them, or marks one NOT VERIFIED. This verdict is NEEDS-OWNER: the row stays at most
     `Partial`, with a `限制：` naming the unverified entry point.
   - **No second view.** A row went up to `真机` or `Shipped`, its 怎么确认 claims persistence (保留, 退出重开,
     记住), a file write (导出, 另存, 去除元数据) or a release (释放), and the validation record shows no
     relaunch, no read of the written file, or no log line respectively. This verdict is NEEDS-OWNER.
   - **Self-certification.** Every commit here can share one git author, so authorship proves nothing; the
     check reads commit trailers instead. For each row that went up to `真机` or `Shipped`, find the commit
     that added or changed its `docs/validation/` section. It is self-certification, and the verdict is
     NEEDS-OWNER, when any of these holds:
     - that commit has no `Validated-by: <role> run=<run-id>` trailer;
     - the role in it also appears in an `Implemented-by: <role>` trailer on a commit in the range that
       touches the row's paths;
     - the same commit also changes source code (anything outside `docs/`).

     The record must come from the device tester, in its own commit.
   - **Format.** Every touched row must also pass the ledger's format rules:
     - state and 验证 are in their enums;
     - a `Partial` row carries `限制：`;
     - an `Absent` row has `—` in 在哪;
     - no path has a line number, a count or a build output;
     - the acceptance part of 怎么确认 (the text before 「限制：」) is no longer than three sentences or about 150 characters.
       The 「限制：」 text does not count toward this length (user, 2026-10-26: 「放宽规则」); do not propose compressing it,
       but do flag a 限制 clause that is not a fact (process, history or a log belongs in `docs/validation/`).
   - **Stale HTML.** Run `node scripts/ledger/build.mjs --check` at `<head>`. If it fails, the verdict is
     NEEDS-OWNER: run `npm run ledger:build` and commit the HTML with the ledger change.
7. **Apply** the edits you are allowed to make in `docs/feature-ledger.md`, then run `npm run ledger:build`
   (or `node scripts/ledger/build.mjs`) so `docs/feature-ledger.html` matches. Do not stage or commit.
   The caller reviews `git diff -- docs/feature-ledger.md docs/feature-ledger.html` and commits both files as
   `docs(ledger): garden <base7>..<head7>`.
8. **Write the report** to `~/.picsee/gardening/<branch>-<head7>.md`, creating the folder if needed, and
   return it as your final message.

In `full` mode, take the base as the commit that last touched each area's Part 3 row, then run steps
4–8 for each area.

## Boundaries

- Edit nothing but `docs/feature-ledger.md` and its generated `docs/feature-ledger.html`; edit the HTML only
  through `npm run ledger:build` (or `node scripts/ledger/build.mjs`). Never stage, commit, push, rebase or
  switch branches.
- Run no tests, app builds or the app. The ledger HTML generator and its `--check` mode are the only build
  commands allowed; you read evidence, you do not create it.
- Never read audit reports or PR comments. Your verdict must be independent of the auditors.
- A row you can't decide is NEEDS-OWNER with your reason, not a guess.

## Output

```
GARDENER  <pr|full> · <branch> · <base7>..<head7>
VERDICT   CLEAN | UPDATED | NEEDS-OWNER | BLOCK
APPLIED   <n> edits
  - <ID> · <moved path | removed path | downgraded: reason | link | area review>
PROPOSED  (owner must act before the PR opens)
  - <ID or "new row"> · <what to change> · evidence: <file or commit>
UNAFFECTED
  - <ID> · <one-line reason>
BLOCKERS
  - <ID> · <weakened acceptance | upgrade without evidence> · <commit>
NOT CHECKED  <anything you could not read or decide, and why>
PR-LINE   Ledger-Gardener: <VERDICT> <base7>..<head7> (<n> applied, <n> proposed)
```

Each verdict means:

| Verdict | Meaning | What the caller does next |
|---|---|---|
| CLEAN | Nothing stale, nothing proposed | Puts the PR line in the PR body and opens the PR |
| UPDATED | Only edits you were allowed to apply | Commits the ledger and HTML diff, then opens the PR |
| NEEDS-OWNER | At least one proposal | The owner updates the rows, or writes `无用户可见变化：<ID> <reason>` in the PR body for each one; then the caller runs the gate with `--since <this head> --verdict NEEDS-OWNER`, and reruns the gardener only on `RUN` |
| BLOCK | Weakened acceptance or an unevidenced upgrade | The PR does not open until the commit is split or the evidence exists |

The gate's SKIP, REUSE and RESOLVED lines (see When it runs) stand in for the PR line and go into the PR body
the same way.
