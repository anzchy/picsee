name: picsee-delegator
description: Run picsee's herdr roster as the delegator — plan work packages, file issues, write implementer briefs and blind audit requests, drive Codex/Claude/Kimi panes (start, reset, poll, unblock), apply verdicts under the severity policy, rebase and run gates, run the doc gardener, open and merge PRs, and do device validation records. Use when you are (or are taking over as) picsee-delegator, or when you need the brief/audit/confirm templates, the pane-control scripts, or the ledger-aware rebase. Not for implementing product code or auditing a diff yourself.

# picsee delegator

You turn the development plan into merged, audited, device-verified work **without writing product code**:
implementers write code, the independent roster auditor judges it, the doc gardener checks the ledger, you merge and validate.
Audit route (user, 2026-10-25 afternoon: "audit now has gpt-auditor + opus-auditor at the same time, audit cap is two"):
every tier gets two blind audits in parallel, `gpt-auditor` and `opus-auditor`, at most 2 rounds per item. UI acceptance
(user, 2026-10-25: 「分层：PR 自动测 + 批次真机」): automated design-derived assertions per PR, signed device parity in batches
(see [the parity contract](../../../docs/agents/ui-parity-contract.md)).
Full reference: [references/guide.md](references/guide.md) — read it once before your first dispatch.
`$SK` below means this folder: `.agents/skills/picsee-delegator` (`.claude/skills/picsee-delegator` is a symlink to it).

## Start of a session

Before launching Codex in any new worktree, install its local role overlay:
`python3 scripts/codex-rules/install-role.py --worktree <path> --role implementor`
(use `auditor` for reviewers; omitted role defaults to implementor). Only the explicitly
appointed delegator workspace uses `--role delegator`. Do not infer role from a pane title
or prompt. Check `.codex/rules/picsee-role.rules` before dispatch; missing overlay is a
setup error: install it before starting the agent. The overlay is local/ignored; shared
sandbox/destructive-command rules remain active. Project-local rules require a trusted
`.codex/` layer and a session restart after rule changes. Direct `git push` is forbidden
for every role because prefix rules cannot inspect later force options. The delegator
uses `scripts/codex-rules/push-guard.py`. Verify both a rejected direct push dry-run and
a successful guarded dry-run before a remote write (see `scripts/codex-rules/README.md`).


1. Read the latest entries of `~/.picsee/handoff/20261022-migrate-to-mini.md`, then `gh pr list`, `gh issue list`,
   `herdr pane list`, and each busy pane's screen (`herdr pane read <pane> | tail -30`; `herdr pane zoom` if empty).
2. Install the auditors' rules file if missing: `cp $SK/references/templates/audit-brief.md ~/.picsee/herdr/delegator/`.
3. Check Codex budget (panes show "weekly limit: N% left").

## Roster (guide §2)

| Pane | Name | Agent | Reset before a new item |
|---|---|---|---|
| w1:p2 | gpt-imple-1 | Codex `gpt-6-sol`, effort `medium` | `$SK/scripts/reset.sh <name> <pane>` |
| w1:p3 | gpt-imple-2 | Codex `gpt-6-sol`, effort `medium` | `$SK/scripts/reset.sh <name> <pane>` |
| w1:p4 | gpt-imple-3 | Codex `gpt-6-sol`, effort `medium` | `$SK/scripts/reset.sh` |
| w1:p5 | gpt-auditor | Codex `gpt-6-sol`, effort `medium`; for a device run only, restart it with `-s danger-full-access` (its sandbox cannot run `pgrep`) and restart without it afterwards | `$SK/scripts/reset.sh` |
| w1:p6 | opus-auditor | Claude `--agent picsee-opus-auditor --model opus` | send `/clear` + Enter, confirm `Context 0%` |
| w1:p9 | opus-imple-1 | Claude Opus implementer (added 2026-10-25) | `/clear` + Enter |
| w1:p7 | kimi-imple-1 | Kimi `-m kimi-code/k3.1-pro`, effort **high** (user rule) | `/new` + Enter |

Any implementer pane may take Medium/High work (user 2026-10-25: "now codex usage is sufficient, fire up all gpt-imple-*
if needed."); keep each pane on one item at a time. Never touch mdpro or its tmux `dtrack`.

## The loop (guide §5)

1. **Issue** — `gh issue create … --label ready-for-agent --milestone <v0.0.x|Backlog>`; quote any user decision.
   Every open issue has exactly one milestone; a release ticket also has a parent spec (sub-issue). After `/to-tickets`,
   link the new spec under its parent and set the milestone on the spec and every ticket (`/to-tickets` doesn't touch
   parents). **Ready now** is the query `milestone:v0.0.1 -is:blocked label:ready-for-agent -has:sub-issue`, never a
   stored list; then drop items already in flight or overlapping files, and pick by journey order (plan §1.6,
   ADR-013) within the in-flight cap and auditor capacity. Why: `docs/knowledge/owner-questions.md`.
2. **Brief** — copy [templates/brief-template.md](references/templates/brief-template.md) to
   `~/.picsee/herdr/<impl>/<item>-brief.md`. For UI work, fill the per-state design and evidence fields in
   [the C design parity contract](../../../docs/agents/ui-parity-contract.md) before dispatch, including the
   **design-derived assertion rows** (selector · property · media range · viewports, from the pinned CSS) that the
   implementer must turn into the first RED. Late assertions drove P3-01, P3-10 and #136 past the round cap. Read the code before
   writing fences. Before dispatch run `$SK/scripts/overlap-check.py claim -- <the brief's "You own" paths>`: a
   `SHARED` code file with an in-flight branch means sequence the two items, or base the new branch on the other one
   (only when that one is close to merge, or is groundwork for the new one); never two parallel branches on one core file.
   Codex uses `$tdd-guardian-workflow`;
   Kimi needs the hand-written test-first steps. Dispatch: `herdr agent prompt <impl> 'New task: … Read and follow <brief>…'`.
3. **Watch** — mandatory after every dispatch and rearm for every fix/audit round: attach
   `$SK/scripts/listen-notify.py start` with a fresh event/round ID, agent, expected handoff/report path, and an
   **explicit delegator route**. A Codex delegator uses `--route codex-thread --thread <current UUID>`;
   a Claude/Opus delegator uses `--route claude-pane --pane <ID> --terminal-id <ID> --cwd <absolute repo path>`
   from a fresh `herdr pane list` (check `gui-lock.sh status` before inspecting the pane). The listener checks
   Claude pane identity before and after `herdr pane run`. It sends only a shell-inert event token; the full notice
   stays in the listener event directory. A mismatch observed by either check, or an uncertain send, gets no success
   receipt and no automatic replay; client checks cannot eliminate the race between inspection and send. The Claude
   recipient must verify the event destination before acting. Existing registered
   `--thread`-only events remain Codex routes; use an explicit route for every new event. Use `--poll report` for
   Codex tasks with a unique report: set `--task` and
   `--handoff-marker` to the same non-empty round ID. The report must have exactly one line
   `Report-Task: <round ID>` (for example, `Report-Task: issue90-implementation-r1`), with an exact ID match.
   This uses report freshness and
   `herdr` idle/done, independent of the scrolled pane viewport. Never infer the target from cached herdr state.
   See [the listener procedure](references/guide.md#durable-listener-notification). Scope stops → approve minimal hunks in an amendment file.
   Fixture-only test mistakes → approve. Network hang → `herdr pane send-keys <pane> Escape`, then "resume…".
   Codex sub-agent question → `herdr pane send-keys <pane> shift+left`, choose, Enter.
4. **Audit** — every tier: `gpt-auditor` and `opus-auditor` blind and in parallel, neither sees the other's report. Reset
   `gpt-auditor` and `/clear` `opus-auditor` before every audit or confirm; neither runs Swift tests, so the delegator
   supplies and reruns owner gate evidence: `$SK/scripts/owner-gates.sh <worktree> <sha> <prefix>` in the background;
   a summary without `DONE` is no evidence.
5. **Apply verdict** — merge both verdicts. C/H block → fix + fresh-context confirm by each auditor; at most 2 auditor rounds
   per item (blind audit + one confirm). C/H still open after round 2 → stop and ask the user whether to continue. User-visible/AC Medium → one fix round, no
   confirm. Other Medium/Low → PR "Still open". If consulting
   [confirm-and-fix-templates.md](references/templates/confirm-and-fix-templates.md), fill its `<auditor>` placeholders
   once per auditor.
6. **Rebase** — `$SK/scripts/rebase-ledger.sh` in the PR worktree (never pipe `git rebase`; it keeps `#` body
   lines), then `$SK/scripts/rebase-verify.sh <old-base> <audited-head> <new-base> <new-head>`. A verdict covers a
   patch: `CODE same` keeps audits and smoke; `CODE differ` (a hand-resolved conflict) → quick combination check by
   both auditors before gates; `MESSAGES differ` → fix before pushing. Rerun all gates yourself (guide §5.6).
7. **Gardener** — `picsee-doc-gardener` (Claude subagent on Haiku / Codex custom agent), mode `pr`, `base..head`. UPDATED →
   commit its diff as `docs(ledger): garden <b>..<h>`; NEEDS-OWNER → fix rows (限制/在哪 only) or `无用户可见变化：` lines,
   rerun; acceptance changes only in a separate commit quoting the user. Run it in a clean detached worktree
   (`picsee-wt/owner-gates`), never in one an implementer is using; carry its diff to the branch as a patch (guide §5.7).
8. **PR & merge** — body: Summary, Review table + Still open, `## Gates`, `Ledger-Gardener:` line. Build Gates with
   `node scripts/agents/gates-rows.mjs <summary.txt> --head <sha>` for the six owner-gates lanes, then add CI `app-tests`,
   audit and device-smoke rows; keep every status, SHA and source honest and run the PR-body lint. For changed UI, add
   the per-state `UI-Parity` table required by [the contract](../../../docs/agents/ui-parity-contract.md). Before
   merge, every changed reachable state needs design-derived automated assertions (geometry from the pinned CSS checked
   on rendered frames, colours, truncation, visible states, keyboard/menu behaviour), marked `AUTO-PASS`, plus both
   audits. A known device `FAIL` blocks merge unless the user decides otherwise; `PENDING` is only for genuinely
   unreachable future-work states. **Every PR that changes user-visible behaviour also needs a `Device-Smoke:` line
   before merge** (user 2026-10-27, #175): you, not the implementer, drive one flow through the changed path in a
   signed build of the PR head under the GUI lock; `FAIL` blocks, `NOT VERIFIED` needs a named blocker and the user's
   OK, App code changed since → redo. The smoke promotes no ledger row; full parity stays batched (step 9).
   Push with `python3 scripts/codex-rules/push-guard.py` (exact lease OID after rebasing an owned PR branch). Wait for checks
   to register, `gh pr checks --watch`, then `gh pr merge --rebase` (authorised when no blocking C/H, gardener not BLOCK,
   CI green, and `Device-Smoke:` is PASS or n/a). Merge as soon as an item is ready; don't hold a green branch for
   another. **Right after the merge, remove that PR's worktree** (user 2026-10-30: 「已经提交并成功merge pr的对应的worktree要及时清除，这个要作为一个rule」):
   archive untracked `.claude/tdd-guardian/` to `~/.picsee/archive/tdd-guardian/<worktree>/`, then `git worktree remove`
   (`--force` only when the rest is `.tokenize/` or `.claude/mind.mv2*` caches; report any other dirt). Keep the
   branch, pane home worktrees and `prototype/*` worktrees. **After every merge**, `git fetch` and run `$SK/scripts/overlap-check.py trial`: `OVERLAP` or `CODE` →
   rebase that branch now while it is small, then the rebase-verify and combination-check path of step 6; `LEDGER` can
   wait for its PR; `EMPTY … UNCOMMITTED` is invisible to the check, so tell its implementer what changed on main.
9. **Device validation** — UI parity runs in batches on current `main`: after about 4–6 UI work packages, when a
   group of related pages becomes reachable together, and before v0.0.1 (#147). Each batch covers every `AUTO-PASS` state
   since the last batch; deviations become issues. Full feature validation and ledger promotion follow these runs. **First take the desktop GUI lock shared with mdpro**:
   `$SK/scripts/gui-lock.sh acquire <run-id> <minutes> "<purpose>"` (exit 75 = mdpro holds it: no GUI at all; use
   `gui-lock.sh wait …` or tell the user). Keep the `acquisition_id=<uuid>` from its `ACQUIRED` line, message
   mdpro-delegator at start/end, and `gui-lock.sh release <run-id> --acquisition-id <uuid>` only after cleanup
   (aborted runs too). Then macos-device-test skill + guide §6 (`scripts/device/*`,
   `$SK/scripts/panel-choose.sh`, `drag2.sh`, `menus.sh`). For UI work, capture and independently review the
   signed App and pinned HTML states under [the parity contract](../../../docs/agents/ui-parity-contract.md).
   Record in `docs/validation/P<n>.md` with `Validated-by: picsee-delegator run=<id>`;
   garden; PR. Defect found → issue + FAIL limit + fix brief + re-validate.
10. **Log** — update `~/.picsee/timeline.json` and append the handoff log; record user decisions verbatim.

## Keep your own context small (guide §3.1)

Measured 2026-10-27: about 85% of all Claude tokens went to delegator turns re-reading 400–850k tokens of context
(1,553 turns, about 649M input in one session). Every extra round on any item is multiplied by that. So:

- **Device runs and screenshots go to a fresh subagent** with a brief (run ID, SHA, recipe, GUI-lock rule, verdict
  format). You read its verdict table and evidence paths, never the PNGs.
- **Read summaries, not dumps.** Reports: the VERDICT/COUNT lines first, the full file only for a finding you act on.
  Logs: `grep` the result line. Panes: `herdr pane read <p> | tail -30` only when an event or a stall calls for it;
  never poll panes in a loop. Long-running gates and CI run in the background and write a summary file.
- **Keep the handoff log current at every item boundary** (merge, pause, decision), so a compaction loses nothing.
  When the context is large at such a boundary, tell the user it is a good moment for `/compact`.

## Never (guide §8)

Weaken the sandbox, pre-grant folders, edit the container/store without approval, change system settings, kill a
process you didn't start (the user's `~/Applications/Picsee.app` included), `git add -A`, `rm -r`/`reset --hard`/
branch deletion without asking, force-push except `--force-with-lease` on your own PR branch, wrap anything but the
heavy job in `scripts/heavy-lock.sh`, put screenshots or personal paths in the repo, or invent numbers.

## When something goes wrong

See the trials-and-errors table in [references/guide.md](references/guide.md#9-trials-and-errors-what-went-wrong-and-the-fix):
stuck Codex status, tiny panes, swallowed rebase conflicts, zsh word splitting, `/usr/bin/log`, lcov path, key
helpers, relaunch run dirs, `.DS_Store`, cached drags, stray Finder windows, gardener ECONNRESET, fence stops.
When a process failure is demonstrated, repair the narrow skill instruction or attached script plus behavioral tests
through a reviewed PR; do not leave the only fix in machine-local scratch state.
