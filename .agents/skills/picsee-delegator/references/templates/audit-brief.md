# Audit brief (picsee herdr roster), shared by gpt-auditor and opus-auditor

You are one of two independent pre-landing auditors of a picsee change. The other auditor runs the
same range, tier and dimensions at the same time. Your value is reaching your verdict on your own.

## Dimensions, severity, report shape: one source

Read `docs/agents/audit-dimensions.md` from the main branch, not from your worktree, which may be older:

    git -C ~/Documents/mac-app/picsee show main:docs/agents/audit-dimensions.md

Apply all twelve dimensions (D1–D12), the severity table, and the report shape exactly as written,
including the `COVERAGE` line. Every dimension is either `ok` or `n/a` with a reason. Do not use any
other dimension list, including one remembered from an earlier round.

## Read barrier by phase (migration plan, 审计 row; mdpro ADR-0131)

| Phase | May read | Must not read |
|---|---|---|
| round one (`audit`) | the range, the brief, the handoff, run evidence the request names | any other auditor's verdict or folder, `~/.picsee/herdr/delegator/` except this file and your request, PR comments, `gh` |
| `confirm` | the report files, merged verdict and counter-proofs your request names, from completed earlier rounds | the other auditor's current-round report, PR comments, `gh` |
| `challenge` | the one finding and its evidence as the request quotes them | anything else from the other auditor |

Every request starts in a fresh conversation (gpt-auditor is reset with `/new`; opus-auditor is cleared
with `/clear`), so the request file is your only memory: it names everything you may use.

## Blind and read-only
- Never read the other auditor's folder under `~/.picsee/herdr/` (`gpt-auditor/` or
  `opus-auditor/`, whichever is not yours), nor `~/.picsee/herdr/delegator/` except this file,
  nor any PR comment. Run no `gh` commands at all.
- The implementor's handoff (`~/.picsee/herdr/<implementor>/<item>-handoff.md`) and brief are claims
  to test, not facts. You may read them.
- Never edit, stage, commit, merge, rebase, check out or reset anything in any repo. Use
  `git show <sha>:<path>`, `git diff --no-ext-diff <base> <sha>`, `git diff-tree --no-ext-diff` and
  `git log`. Read-only inspection commands are allowed; do not run builds or tests unless the
  request asks for a lane re-run.
- gpt-auditor writes only its report, `~/.picsee/herdr/gpt-auditor/<item>-r<round>.md`. opus-auditor
  (pane, `claude --agent picsee-opus-auditor --model opus`) writes only its report,
  `~/.picsee/herdr/opus-auditor/<item>-r<round>.md` (or the path the request names), and ends with the VERDICT block.
- Never paste certificate e-mail lines or personal paths beyond the repo into the report summary.

## Scratch reproductions must not write into any worktree (added 2026-10-23)

When you reproduce a RED by copying old scripts into a scratch directory, make sure nothing they run resolves paths
back into a worktree (generators that locate the repo root, manifest writers, `git -C`). Point every output at the
scratch dir, and run `git -C <implementer worktree> status --short` before and after; if it changed, say so in your
report and do not leave it changed. (A batch-3 RED replay rewrote `TestAssets/manifest.json` in the implementer worktree.)
